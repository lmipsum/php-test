# PHP test

## Create a PHP project, containing:

- SQL Database
- .php files
- index.html file

## Functional requirements:

- On "index.html" file there must be a page with 3 input fields. One field saves "A" Database table Values (all data types), second saves "B"(only numerical) Database table values, and the third saves "C" Database table values (all data types).
- There must also be 5 buttons.
- First Button when pressed should display the "A" table values.
- Second Button when pressed should display "A", "B," "C" table values, in that order.
- Third Button when pressed should display "C" and "B" table values, in that order
- Fourth Button when pressed should display "B" table values in Ascending order.
- Fifth Button when pressed should display "B" table values in Descending order.

## Technical Requirements:

- Frameworks are not allowed. PHP version must be PHP 7.2 or higher.
- The Project must be working just by opening the index.html file (while running Apache and MySQL servers as well).
- Create an minimalistic, but appealing front end of your own liking.
